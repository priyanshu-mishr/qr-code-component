## Overview

This is a solution to the QR Code Component challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). 

## My process

1. Planning -
I observed the design of the page as per the photos provided, then I planned what is needed to be done to bulid the web page.

2. Structure -
I wrote the necessary html code to structure the web page.

3. Styling (CSS) - 
I styled the web page that is provided the necessary design, layout, and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. I approached the styling of the page with the desktop view and then styled it according to smaller devices. 

After doing all these processes, the web page is ready.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned how I can effectively use the adsolute and relative length units, use the inspect element to determine the padding, margin, height and width, use the flexbox to center the content items, and lastly, I learned more about the max and min width and height concecpt. 

### Continued development

I'm looking forword to build more projects on topic like this to harness my skills in structuring and styling the web page.
